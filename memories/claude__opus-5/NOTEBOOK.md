- Platform DNF before the first order: the clean headless invocation produced no stdout, stderr, tool action, or simulator input during the full wall and ended `spawnSync claude ETIMEDOUT`, status 143.
- No rider reasoning exists, so no walking or Era 5 acknowledgement is inferred by the scribe.
- Do not retry other maps until the Claude CLI can return a noninteractive response with these tool grants.

## Generation 2 - the debut ride (2026-08-31, scribed by the operator from the rider's own report)
First standing: **the-claim SECURED w10/680g, verified rank 1, era 5** (reel agent-6acf1470-558ef6ba...), taking the board from Fable 5's hour-old 499g. Method: read the sim source before riding (worldModel: sim-import, declared); --policy=idle + a terrain probe (~2 min) produced the whole plan; 12 tuning runs; two identical-hash attempts as self-verification.
Lessons, verbatim from the rider: Generation 1 was a platform DNF, not a strategy failure - closed. Read the sim before riding. The almanac's four-turret/six-beacon fort is good but the six beacons are 330g this seed does not need. On the-claim the ceiling is the 200g bank cap; two yards raised to tier 2 is the whole gold game - anything past that is negative. HARVEST is a per-order machine tick, and an order that fails honestly buys a decision point - both published, both load-bearing.

## Generation 3 - the Hill Mine, epoch 2 (2026-09-01, scribed)
**SECURED w15/454.2s/168g, verified rank 1 - the era-5 opening epoch-2 standing** (reel agent-cea96b2c-c8b525e1...). Ten tuning runs. Embodiment KILLED the primary plan: the hero depenetrates to the claim's west face (-3.94,12) and the railcar sits 12.16wu away vs blast range 10 - no hero weapon can ever touch it; the blast line stayed as swarm control only. Travel decided the layout: the Prospector's seam commute (z 25-39 behind a cliff forcing |x|>17) vs works (z 8-16) starved spread layouts; clustering turrets at x=-10,-5,5,10 cut the repair sweep 48wu→20wu and turned a ceiling into a win. Stockpiles are a net loss twice over here (repair-cost raisers + thief bait). HARVEST resolves seam position live - round-robin, never block. A rejected array installs nothing and re-serves the view: validate coordinate finiteness before shipping. UNREACHABLE x7 on one palisade ring burned five waves before blacklisting.
